# Pet Palace API

## Models

At the start of the project, a database model was created to map out the scope and information needs for the database.
The post, comments, likes, following and profile entities are greatly inspired by the Code Institue django rest API walkthrough project, the rest is custom to this project.

A conceptual model was made at first to easily visualise what the database would look like and which entities were needed.

Once that was finished a more detailed logical database model was made with all attributes and data types.

The scope of the database is quite wide to take into consideration that the project might grow in the future, leaving room for future features that might not be implemented in the first release.

## Apps

The Pet Palace API has got # nr of apps, the different apps and their purpose is described as follows:

### Profile app

An app for the user's profile, the profile is created automatically when they sign up and create a user, the profile can only be edited, it is not possible to delete it, and the user can also only have one profile.

The profile model holds information about the user,
such as name, description of them, profile image, if they are a pet owner or not,
and when the profile was created and updated.

The name will be generated from the username, and a default image will be displayed until the user changes it.
If the user is a pet owner, they will need to update their profile and check the checkbox for a pet owner, if not, they will be a regular user.
If the user checks the pet owner box, they will get a small icon next to their name, and users should be able to filter to display posts and ads from only pet owners if they'd like.

### Post app

The code for the Post app is greatly inspired by the Code Institute django rest framework walkthrough, with minor alterations to fit my project.

All logged-in users will be able to create, update and delete a post.
The post will contain an image, title, content, category, date of creation and date of updating.

The content field is allowed to be blank, but the user must add a title, if they donâ€™t add an image a default will be displayed.
The user can also add a filter to the image.

## Setting up the project

I have followed the Code Institutes template from the Django rest DRF_API walkthrough to set up the project with Django and Cloudinary.

1. The first step was to use the Code institute full template to create a new repository and open it in Gitpod.

2. Installing Django from the terminal `pip3 install 'django<4'`

3. Create a project: `django-admin startproject pet_palace_api`

4. Cloudinary libraries to manage static files `pip install django-cloudinary-storage`

5. Add Pillow for image processing `pip install Pillow`

6. Add cloudinary to INSTALLED_APPS

7. Create an env.py file and import os `import os`

8. Set the url variable value `os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://my-API-Environment-variable'`

9. Import os and add if statement in setting.py
```
import os
if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

```

10. Setting the CLOUDINARY_STORAGE variable to equal the CLOUDINARY_URL variable 
```
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')
}
```

11. Add media storage URL `MEDIA_URL = '/media/'`

12. Set default file storage to cloudinary 
```
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 
    'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

Now the basic project was finished, the next step were to start setting up all the apps and adding them to the settings.py file.

## Testing

### Profile app

In the profile app, there was one automated test to make sure that a profile was created for every new user.

![testcaseprofiles](/documentation/testing/profilecreatetest.png)

The test failed the first time due to that there were three users created and the test only expected two profiles,
when changed to expect three profiles instead the test was successful.

### Post app

Most of the tests in the Post app are from the Code Institute django rest walkthrough, however, four custom tests were made, two for deleting posts and two for making sure the correct default value was set.

All tests passed.
